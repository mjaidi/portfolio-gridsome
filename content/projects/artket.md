  Artket is the first online platform regrouping art galleries throughout
  Morocco. The platform showcases artwork from multiple galleries in different
  cities and makes the artwork searchable by location and category.


  Users can save artwork and later get suggestions when similar artwork is added to the website.


  Clients may contact the galleries of choice through an internal messaging system in order to discuss purchasing details.



  Galleries can boost their online presence by creating a mini-site and promoting upcoming events and exhibitions. They can manage their presence through a private members area where they can add artwork, artists and exhibitions.
