  When I am not working on freelance projects I enjoy sharing my passion by teaching at the LeWagon Coding Bootcamp. I teach Ruby on Rails and help guide bootcamp graduates through their final projects and pitches.


  I find that teaching is a great way to meet people, solidify existing skills and keep learning.
