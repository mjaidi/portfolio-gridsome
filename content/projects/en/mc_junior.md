MasterChef Junior is a local tv show that was looking to streamline their casting process by building an online platform.


The platform includes a landing page presenting the TV Show, a members area for potential candidates to fill out an enrolment form, and an administrative area to handle the casting process. After a candidate fills out the form, casting managers can read his/her profile, place a rating on the candidate and send an automatic email invitation to attend a face-to-face meeting.


The static pages were built using Ruby on Rails, and the dynamic pages including form wizards and dashboards were built using Vue.js.


Due to extremely short deadline of the casting agency, this project was completed in 4 days.
