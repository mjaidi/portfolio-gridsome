Patibis pastry management system is my first dev project. It was built using the DBMS platform Filemaker Pro.


It is an Enterprise Resource Planning system for managing a pastry operation. It handles recipes (bill of materials), costing, purchasing management, sales management (quotes, invoices and payments), production tracking, inventory management, customer management and provides detailed sales reports.
