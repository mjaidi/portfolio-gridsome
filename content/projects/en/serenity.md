Serenity is an insurance management software built for one of the largest car insurance agents in Morocco. The agent wanted to rebuild a legacy system with modern technology and functionality improvements.


The platform provides insurance quotes, delivers insurance certificates, manages payments, tracks cash and check payments until they are paid into the bank, sends renewal reminders to customers when an insurance is close to expiring, and fully integrates with the parent insurance companys' api to ensure the conformity of information shared between the company and the agent.


We were two developers collaborating on this project working on front-end, back-end and api integration.
