    description: `Following enriching experiences in consulting and civil engineering, I have recently fell in love with web development and the technology sector. \n
    I am passionate about learning new things and adapting to the latest technologies and trends in order to provide the best experience for end users. \n
    I am a well organised, independent, problem solver with high attention to detail.  I am interested in the entire web development spectrum, from software architecture to UX and UI design. \n
    Fan of outdoor activities, hikes, travels, and meeting new people wherever I go.  I look forward to working on interesting projects with inspiring people around the world.
